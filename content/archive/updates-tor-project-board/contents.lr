									<p><img alt="" src="https://blog.torproject.org/sites/default/files/inline-images/board-september.png" style="width: 600px; height: 300px;" /></p>

									<p>We would like to share some updates regarding the Tor Project&rsquo;s Board. We had two members stepping down, Megan Price and Shari Steele, both provided great contributions for the Board that Tor will always be thankful for. And we are grateful to have them as supporters and friends of Tor.</p>

									<p>To move forward we decided to invite two new members. We are happy to say both have accepted our invitation and joined the Board. <strong>Rabbi Rob</strong>, the founder and CEO of Team Cymru and <strong>Chelsea Komlo</strong>, cryptography and privacy researcher and engineer.</p>

									<p>This August, we asked you to help us fundraise for our second annual Bug Smash Fund campaign. This fund is designed to grow a healthy reserve earmarked for maintenance work, finding bugs, and smashing them&mdash;all tasks necessary to keep Tor Browser, the Tor network, and the many tools that rely on Tor strong, safe, and running smoothly.</p>

									<p>In 2019, we raised $86,081, half of which we raised in-person at DEFCON.</p>

									<p><strong>In 2020, despite the challenges of COVID-19 and event cancellations, you helped us to raise $106,709! </strong><a href="https://blog.torproject.org/tor-bug-smash-fund-2020-106K-raised">Check out our &#39;thank you!&#39; post.</a></p>

									<p><span>Between 2019 and 2020, the Tor Project has had the opportunity to serve as the host organization of OTF Information Controls Fellow, Babatunde Okunoye.</span></p>

									<p><span>As part of his fellowship, Babatunde examined the use of Internet censorship circumvention tools in Cameroon, Nigeria, Uganda, and Zimbabwe, four countries in Africa with varying degrees of Internet censorship, including Internet bandwidth throttling, social media app restrictions, and website blocks. Interviews were done with 33 people, including students, civil society members, people in business, and teachers, revealing how communities mobilized to defeat censorship. <a href="https://blog.torproject.org/icfp-otf-censored-continent">You can read a summary of Babatunde&#39;s findings and the full report here.&nbsp;</a></span></p>

									<p>Every year the Tor Project hosts interns through programs like Outreachy and Google Summer of Code. Hashik&nbsp;worked with our anti-censorship team to bring Snowflake proxy to Android.</p>

									<p>&ldquo;Tor&rsquo;s community is very welcoming; all the Tor core developers are down to earth, humble, and easy to approach for any technical difficulty. Any interested person can barge into their IRC channels and ask any question, and either the developers or the fellow folks in the community<br />
									would answer our questions.&rdquo;</p>

									<p>We are happy that Hashik&nbsp;had a great time at the Tor Project. &nbsp;<a href="https://blog.torproject.org/gsoc-2020-snowflake-proxy-mobile">Check out his final report here.</a></p>
