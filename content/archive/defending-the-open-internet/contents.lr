												<h1>Our New Anti-Censorship Team is Defending The Open Internet</h1>

												<div class="field field--name-body field--type-text-with-summary field--label-hidden field--item quickedit-field" data-quickedit-field-id="node/1732/body/en/full" property="schema:text">
												<p><a href="https://blog.torproject.org/tors-new-anti-censorship-team-defending-open-internet"><img alt="" src="https://blog.torproject.org/sites/default/files/styles/full_width/public/image/john-matychuk-dJdcb11aboQ-unsplash_1.jpg.png?itok=Gw-wK5o4" style="width: 640px; height: 321px;" /></a></p>

												<p>At the non-profit organization level, the Tor Project consists of several teams. The <a href="https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/wiki/org/teams/NetworkTeam">network team</a> works on part of the back-end: the program called tor, network simulators, onion services, etc.; the <a href="https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/wiki/org/teams/MetricsTeam">metrics team</a> collects and publishes Tor network metrics; the <a href="https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/wiki/org/teams/ApplicationsTeam">applications team</a> maintains Tor Browser and other user-facing applications; the <a href="https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/wiki/org/teams/UxTeam">UX team</a> improves user experience across all projects; the <a href="https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/wiki/org/teams/CommunityTeam">community team</a> fosters a healthy community around Tor; <a href="https://ooni.torproject.org">OONI</a> maintains a global observation network for detecting censorship, surveillance, and traffic manipulation on the internet; the communications team gets our message out to the world; and the <a href="https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/wiki/org/teams/FundraisingTeam">fundraising team</a> rallies people to financially support our vision so we can keep Tor strong for millions around the world.</p>

												<p>All of our teams share a common vision: for people around the world to enjoy privacy and freedom online. As censorship has increased around the world and <a href="https://blog.torproject.org/strength-numbers-internet-freedom-line">internet freedom has declined</a>, <a href="https://blog.torproject.org/expect-more-tor-2019">we realized</a> we needed to step up our game to outpace the censors preventing people from enjoying the human right to freedom of expression and access to information on the internet.</p>

												<p><a href="https://blog.torproject.org/tors-new-anti-censorship-team-defending-open-internet"><img alt="" src="https://blog.torproject.org/sites/default/files/inline-images/unhr19-tor.png" style="width: 640px; height: 320px;" /></a></p>

												<p>In February, we created a brand new <a href="https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/wiki/org/teams/AntiCensorshipTeam">anti-censorship team</a>. This team consists of two software engineers with research backgrounds and a project manager, but there are many other people who contribute to the team&rsquo;s work&mdash;by adding valuable code, insight into past work, infrastructure, and resources. The goal of the anti-censorship team is to understand network censorship and build technology to circumvent it so the Tor network can be accessible to everyone.</p>

												<p>To kick things off, we&#39;ve released a technical report called &quot;<a href="https://research.torproject.org/techreports/dos-censorship-report2-2019-05-31.pdf">Addressing Denial of Service Attacks on Free and Open Communication on the Internet.</a>&quot; This report, part of the first project the team engaged in, provides a comprehensive overview of the state of our anti-censorship roadmap. The report outlines recent improvements and open challenges around BridgeDB, GetTor, snowflake, pluggable transports, censorship analysis, and censorship-related user experience.</p>

												<p>Are you interested in following the anti-censorship team&#39;s work or joining the team? Then <a href="https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/wiki/org/teams/AntiCensorshipTeam">check out our wiki page</a>. It has all details regarding our weekly IRC meeting, our public mailing list, and the software projects we maintain.</p>

												<p>We are determined to make privacy and freedom online accessible to all, and we hope you&rsquo;ll join us. If you&rsquo;re unable to volunteer, <a href="https://donate.torproject.org">your donation</a> can help us tackle this critical challenge.</p>

												<h1>Reflections from Our Stockholm All-Hands</h1>

												<p><a href="https://blog.torproject.org/reflections-our-stockholm-all-hands"><img alt="tor-group-pic" src="https://blog.torproject.org/sites/default/files/styles/full_width/public/image/tor-meeting-pic-stockholm.png?itok=IHgugMwu" style="width: 640px; height: 320px;" /></a></p>

												<p>This month, the Tor Project held our biannual all hands meeting, this time in Stockholm, Sweden. During our all hands meetings, we bring together staff, key volunteers, and collaborators from partner organizations like <a href="https://freedom.press">Freedom of the Press Foundation</a>, <a href="https://tails.boum.org">Tails</a>, <a href="https://guardianproject.info/">the Guardian Project</a>, and <a href="https://mozilla.org">Mozilla</a>. Our goal at our all hands meetings is to reflect on the last six months, address challenges and successes, plan our work for the next six months, and have important in-person conversations that are only possible when all teams are in the same location.</p>

												<p>For this meeting&rsquo;s location and venue, we relied on one of Tor&rsquo;s biggest strengths--our people.</p>

												<p>On the first night in Stockholm, one of our local volunteers organized a &lsquo;do it yourself&rsquo; welcome dinner for all attendees at Kafe 44, a long-standing nonprofit co-op cafe operating as a cultural social center in the heart of Stockholm.</p>

												<p>We were also blessed with an amazing donation from KTH Royal Institute of Technology, which let us use their facilities for our three day meeting where we spread out across classrooms and engaged in back-to-back sessions organized and led by peers.</p>

												<p>During these three days we had a local collective, Kaf&eacute; Ingenstans, responsible for our lunch. They only cook vegan food with local ingredients and we had the most amazing food. We were even able to give them a big tip that we heard they will use to buy bicycles for their delivery. They also got connected with Kafe 44 after our welcome dinner and now will be serving food there.</p>

												<p>Through partnership with our community and our community&rsquo;s broader connections, we turned limited resources into a safe space to cultivate connections, collaboration, and progress toward the vision and values that we are all working towards at Tor. <a href="https://blog.torproject.org/reflections-our-stockholm-all-hands">Find out how it went</a>.</p>
