<h1>Activists &amp; News Orgs: Onionize Your Sites Against Censorship&nbsp;</h1>

<p><img alt="onion-image" src="https://blog.torproject.org/sites/default/files/styles/full_width/public/image/tor-project-onion-services.png?itok=X7lT7Elz" style="width: 560px; height: 326px;" /></p>

<p>In many countries, censorship of websites with critical information or news is commonplace. If opinions, analysis, or facts contrary to the country&rsquo;s narrative are published, repressive governments can quickly silence those voices by blocking access to those websites.&nbsp;</p>

<p>For instance, in September 2017, one day after Human Rights Watch released a report on systematic&nbsp;<a href="https://www.hrw.org/news/2017/09/06/egypt-torture-epidemic-may-be-crime-against-humanity">torture in Egypt&rsquo;s jails</a>, Egypt blocked access to the HRW website, curtailing its people&rsquo;s access to the report and leaving them uninformed about their own countries treatment of its citizens. Egypt has also blocked numerous news sites, including Al Jazeera, so when&nbsp;<a href="http://www.aljazeera.com/news/2017/09/egypt-blocks-human-rights-watch-website-170908033740219.html">AJ reported on Egypt&rsquo;s block of HRW</a>&nbsp;after the report on torture was released, the most critical audience, the Egyptian people, were less likely to be reached.</p>

<p>Publishing a website using&nbsp;<a href="https://www.torproject.org/docs/onion-services.html.en">onion services</a>&nbsp;over the Tor network is a way to circumvent many state-led methods of censorship. These website addresses end in the TLD .onion. Similar to how the https:// protocol of a website provides more security than the http:// protocol, an onion address also appears to be the same site but gives a visitor more privacy and security through end-to-end encryption and improved authentication.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Visiting an onion address is easy. All that&rsquo;s needed is Tor Browser (Tor Browser is built from Firefox and is similar to use); you visit the onion address in Tor Browser like you visit any web address.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s the onion address of torproject.org:&nbsp;<a href="http://expyuzz4wqqyqhjn.onion/">http://expyuzz4wqqyqhjn.onion/&nbsp;</a></p>

<p><a href="https://open.nytimes.com/https-open-nytimes-com-the-new-york-times-as-a-tor-onion-service-e0d0b67b7482">The New York Times</a>&nbsp;has an onion address:&nbsp;<a href="https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/">https://www.nytimes3xbfgragh.onion/</a></p>

<p>So does&nbsp;<a href="https://www.propublica.org/nerds/a-more-secure-and-anonymous-propublica-using-tor-hidden-services">ProPublica</a>:&nbsp;<a href="https://www.propub3r6espa33w.onion/">https://www.propub3r6espa33w.onion/</a></p>

<p><a href="https://www.torproject.org/download">Download Tor Browser</a>&nbsp;and check them out.</p>

<p>If your organization&rsquo;s site is already blocked anywhere in the world, or if you are calling out injustices, sharing state-suppressed resources, or just want to provide your site and users with better privacy and security,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.torproject.org/docs/tor-onion-service.html">creating an onion version</a>&nbsp;of your website should be your next step.&nbsp;</p>

<p><a href="https://blog.torproject.org/volunteer-spotlight-alec-helps-companies-activate-onion-services">Alec Muffett</a>, a security researcher and longtime member of the Tor Community, has created the&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/alecmuffett/eotk">Enterprise Onion Toolkit (EOTK)</a>&nbsp;to make it easier for you to give a public site a corresponding onion address. You can ping Alec&nbsp;<a href="https://twitter.com/AlecMuffett">on Twitter</a>&nbsp;or join the&nbsp;<a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/eotk-users/join">EOTK mailing list</a>&nbsp;if you have any questions about how to use it.&nbsp;</p>

<p>We want a free and open internet for all, so let&rsquo;s onionize and build it.&nbsp;</p>

<h2 dir="ltr">Alec Helps Companies Activate Onion Services</h2>

<p dir="ltr"><img alt="eotk-hello-onion" src="https://blog.torproject.org/sites/default/files/inline-images/eotk.jpg" style="width: 560px; height: 280px;" /></p>

<p>Alec Muffett has worked in security for 30 years, and has long recognized the importance of distributed systems and Tor&rsquo;s onion routing features: &ldquo;Enabling two peers to communicate with nobody &#39;getting between&#39; them was part of the intention of the original internet. Nowadays there&#39;s a saying: &#39;if you want to share a photo with a friend, why do you have to give it to a multi-billion-dollar corporation, first?&#39;; but Tor offers a disintermediation solution for this, and perhaps all similar, problems.&quot;</p>

<p>He continues: &quot;I believe that disintermediated communication is an important capability, and so I built the Enterprise Onion Toolkit to assist publishers, writers, and virtual communities to connect directly, securely, efficiently, and without intermediaries, to their audiences and membership.&rdquo; <a href="https://blog.torproject.org/volunteer-spotlight-alec-helps-companies-activate-onion-services">Read more</a>&nbsp;about Alec and the EOTK.</p>

<h2>Kat, a Privacy Activism Veteran, Has Been Around Tor People Longer than There&#39;s Been a Tor</h2>

<p>We like to thank our volunteer relay operators by sending them a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.torproject.org/getinvolved/tshirt.html">Tor t-shirt</a>, and Kat helps Jon get those t-shirts out the door. She&rsquo;s also helping with the website, as we begin our redesign and revamp our support and community portals. As if all that wasn&rsquo;t enough, Kat has also set up her own relay, making the Tor network faster, more reliable, and more decentralized.</p>

<p>Setting up a relay is easy, she says. &ldquo;I&#39;d encourage anyone who has access to a server, some bandwidth, and reasonable sysadmin skills to give it a go. More relays mean a stronger Tor network, which means we can better protect the privacy of Tor users around the world.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I want everyone to be able to communicate freely so they can work together to make their worlds better places,&rdquo; she says. &ldquo;I care deeply about privacy, both in the &lsquo;right to be let alone&rsquo; sense and in the &lsquo;space to build and nurture one&#39;s identity&rsquo; sense.&rdquo; <a href="https://blog.torproject.org/volunteer-spotlight-kat-privacy-activism-veteran">Read more</a> about Kat and her work with Tor.</p>
